# Stage 3: Writing Execution Plan — "Social Status Drop"
**Status:** Ready for Drafting  
**Tone:** Business Cyberpunk (Analytical, Bold, Precise)  
**Goal:** Win "Science for Life" Conference

## 1. Executive Summary
This document is the **Master Roadmap** for writing the final business plan. We are moving away from the traditional "boring dealer" concept to the **"Drop Model"** — selling luxury cars like limited edition sneakers.

**Key Narrative Arc:**
1.  **Problem:** Traditional luxury buying is slow, bureaucratic, and boring for Gen Z.
2.  **Solution:** The "Drop" — instant access, high-speed logistics, and social capital.
3.  **Proof:** Deep legal/customs analysis proves we can deliver faster and safer than competitors.

## 2. Section-by-Section Mapping

### I. Title Page (Титульный лист)
*   **Standard Form:** Conforms to `project_data/templates/business_plan.md`.
*   **Visual:** `VIS-01 The Hero.webp` (Background or Cover Art).
*   **Key Text:** Project Name, Author, "Moscow 2026".

### II. Description of Business Idea (Описание бизнес-идеи)
*   **Core Narrative:** We are not selling "transportation". We are an **"Access Provider"**. The car is just the physical token of status. The real product is the speed of acquisition and the content created during the handover.
*   **Source Files:**
    *   `project_plan/1_hard_data_and_logic.md` (Concept definition).
    *   `project_plan/2_visual_concept.md` (Aesthetics).
*   **Visual Integration:** `VIS-02 Street King.webp` (The car in its natural urban habitat).
*   **Killer Feature:** Definition of **"The Drop"** applied to automotive retail: Limited time, limited quantity, high hype.

### III. Market Analysis (Анализ состояния рынка)
*   **Core Narrative:** The "Old Money" market is stable, but the "New Money" (Gen Z, Crypto, Tech) market is underserved. They have cash but hate the dealership experience.
*   **Source Files:**
    *   `project_data/research_data/yagpt/4_market_validation_and_tech/1_demand_in_the_new_luxury_segment.md`.
    *   `project_data/research_data/yagpt/4_market_validation_and_tech/2_Influence_marketing_rates.md` (To show where the audience is).
*   **Visual Integration:** `VIS-06 The Calculator.webp` (Use as a stylistic header for data charts).
*   **Killer Feature:** Data on the **shift from "Ownership" to "Experience"** — stats showing Gen Z prioritizes *access* speed over brand loyalty.

### IV. Value Proposition & TA (Ценностное предложение)
*   **Core Narrative:** Competitors offer "Coffee and a Waitlist". We offer **"Payment -> Keys in 7 Days -> Content for your Reels"**.
*   **Source Files:**
    *   `project_plan/1_hard_data_and_logic.md` (Block 4).
    *   `project_data/research_data/yagpt/4_market_validation_and_tech/3_ai_feasibility.md` (Tech advantage).
*   **Visual Integration:** `VIS-05 AI Interface.webp` (Showing the seamless app/bot ordering process).
*   **Killer Feature:** The **"Content-Ready Handover"** — we provide a professional videographer at delivery, so the client gets immediate ROI in social capital.

### V. Business Model (Бизнес-модель)
*   **Core Narrative:** Low Inventory Risk. We operate on a **Pre-order/Drop basis**. We don't freeze millions in stock sitting in a showroom.
*   **Source Files:**
    *   `project_data/templates/business_plan.md` (Osterwalder structure).
    *   `project_data/research_data/yagpt/3_unit_economics_and_real_estate/1_location_dark_store_event_space.md`.
*   **Visual Integration:** `VIS-04 The Deal.webp` (Focus on the transaction moment).
*   **Killer Feature:** **Negative Cash Conversion Cycle** — customer pays *before* we pay the full customs duty (in many cases), or capital turnover is <14 days vs industry avg 90 days.

### VI. Operational Plan (Операционный план)
*   **Core Narrative:** **Logistics is our backend code.** It must be flawless. We rely on direct import, avoiding "grey schemes" to ensure safety, but using optimized routes for speed.
*   **Source Files:**
    *   `project_data/research_data/yagpt/1_legal_and_customs_framework/1_customs_payment_matrix_2025.md` (**CRITICAL**).
    *   `project_data/research_data/yagpt/2_supply_chain_and_logistics/1_routing_and_timing.md`.
*   **Visual Integration:** `VIS-08 Customs Control.webp` (Visualizing the "Green Corridor").
*   **Killer Feature:** The **"Kyrgyzstan Trap" Analysis**. We explicitly show we *rejected* the cheaper, illegal route. We show the math (Risk of 2.5M RUB penalty). This proves maturity.

### VII. Financial Model (Финансовая модель)
*   **Core Narrative:** High Margin, Low Overhead. No massive glass palace showroom. Just a "Dark Store" + "Event Space".
*   **Source Files:**
    *   `project_data/research_data/yagpt/3_unit_economics_and_real_estate/3_financial_model_marginality.md`.
    *   `project_data/research_data/yagpt/3_unit_economics_and_real_estate/2_cost_of_drop_event_cost.md`.
*   **Visual Integration:** `VIS-07 Elite Logistics.webp` (Used here to metaphorically show the flow of value).
*   **Killer Feature:** **Landed Cost Calculation** to the exact Ruble (25,023,080 ₽ for BMW M5). Precision wins arguments.

### VIII. Appendices (Приложения)
*   **Core Narrative:** Evidence of Feasibility.
*   **Content:**
    *   Detailed Customs Matrix Table.
    *   Logistics Map.
    *   Visual Renders.
*   **Visual Integration:** `VIS-03 The Drop Event.webp` (The emotional finale).

## 3. Writer's Guidelines (ToV)

**Tone of Voice:**
*   **Professional but Bold:** Use terminology (Landed Cost, SAM/SOM, Unit Econ), but deliver it with punchy, short sentences.
*   **No Fluff:** Avoid "unique opportunities" or "leading market leaders". Use facts.
*   **"Business Cyberpunk":** The text should feel like a high-tech briefing.
    *   *Bad:* "We hope to attract young customers who like fast cars."
    *   *Good:* "Target: Gen Z High-Net-Worth Individuals. Strategy: Algorithmic demand prediction and 72h fulfillment."

**Formatting Rules:**
*   Use **Bold** for key numbers.
*   Use `Code Blocks` or Tables for financial data to make it stand out.
*   Every chapter starts with a "Core Thesis" sentence.
