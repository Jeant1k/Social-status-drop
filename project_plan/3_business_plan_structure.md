### [1. Title Page]
*   **1.0. Cover Design**
    *   **Key Argument:** The first impression must be "New Luxury," not "High School Project."
    *   **Data Injection:** Standard academic fields (Name, Grade, Project Title).
    *   **Visual Anchor:** `VIS-01 The Hero.webp` (Full-page background or centered high-res render of the key car model in a dark, neon-lit environment).
    *   **Tone Check:** Formal metadata, but visually striking.

---

### [2. Description of Business Idea]
*   **2.1. The Problem: "The Dealership is Dead"**
    *   **Key Argument:** Traditional luxury retail is slow, bureaucratic, and disconnected from digital culture. Gen Z wants speed and social capital, not coffee and paperwork.
    *   **Data Injection:** Reference concept from `project_plan/1_hard_data_and_logic.md`.
    *   **Visual Anchor:** None here, pure text punch.
    *   **Tone Check:** Aggressive opening. "We are disrupting the status quo."

*   **2.2. The Solution: "Social Status Drop"**
    *   **Key Argument:** We don't sell cars; we provide "Access." The business model is borrowed from Supreme/Nike: Limited Drops, High Hype, Instant Delivery.
    *   **Data Injection:** Define "The Drop" mechanism.
    *   **Visual Anchor:** `VIS-02 Street King.webp` (Caption: "The Asset in its natural habitat — the night city").
    *   **Tone Check:** Visionary but grounded in logic.

*   **2.3. Strategic Goals**
    *   **Key Argument:** Capture the "Fast Money" demographic (Crypto, Tech, Bloggers) who are currently underserved by official dealers (due to sanctions/exits).
    *   **Data Injection:** Mention "Parallel Import 2.0" as a service, not a workaround.
    *   **Tone Check:** Strategic confidence.

### [3. Market Analysis]
*   **3.1. Global Macros: The Shift to "New Luxury"**
    *   **Key Argument:** Ownership is fading; Experience is king. The target audience values the *story* of the purchase as much as the asset.
    *   **Data Injection:** Use data from `project_data/research_data/yagpt/4_market_validation_and_tech/1_demand_in_the_new_luxury_segment.md` regarding Gen Z luxury consumption trends.
    *   **Visual Anchor:** `VIS-06 The Calculator.webp` (Caption: "Market Segmentation Data").
    *   **Tone Check:** Analytical. Use terms like "Paradigm Shift."

*   **3.2. Local Hard Data: The "Sanctions Vacuum"**
    *   **Key Argument:** Official brands left, creating a vacuum. The "Gray Market" is chaotic. We offer a "White Glove" service in a "Wild West" market.
    *   **Data Injection:** Cite stats on parallel import volumes from `project_data/research_data/yagpt/4_market_validation_and_tech/1_demand_in_the_new_luxury_segment.md`.
    *   **Tone Check:** Opportunistic. "Chaos is a ladder."

*   **3.3. Target Audience: The "Digital Elite"**
    *   **Key Argument:** Our client is 25-35, net worth >$1M, made in Tech/Crypto. They live on Instagram/Telegram.
    *   **Data Injection:** Use `project_data/research_data/yagpt/4_market_validation_and_tech/2_Influence_marketing_rates.md` to define where they consume content.
    *   **Tone Check:** Profiling. Precise avatar definition.

### [4. Value Proposition & TA Analysis]
*   **4.1. Unique Selling Point: Speed & Content**
    *   **Key Argument:** We are the only player offering "Payment -> Keys -> Content" in one package.
    *   **Data Injection:** Contrast our "7-day delivery" (from local hub) vs competitor "30-day wait."
    *   **Visual Anchor:** `VIS-05 AI Interface.webp` (Caption: "The User Interface of Luxury — One-Click Ordering").
    *   **Tone Check:** Competitive arrogance backed by facts.

*   **4.2. The "Content-Ready" Handover**
    *   **Key Argument:** Every car comes with a "Media Kit" (Reels, Photos) for the client's social media. We automate their flexing.
    *   **Data Injection:** Mention AI integration from `project_data/research_data/yagpt/4_market_validation_and_tech/3_ai_feasibility.md`.
    *   **Tone Check:** Innovative.

### [5. Business Model]
*   **5.1. The Osterwalder Canvas Adaptation**
    *   **Key Argument:** We run a "Low Asset / High Turnover" model. No showroom ownership (Events only).
    *   **Data Injection:** Use structure from `project_data/templates/business_plan.md`.
    *   **Visual Anchor:** `VIS-04 The Deal.webp` (Caption: "The Transaction Point").
    *   **Tone Check:** Structural clarity.

*   **5.2. Financial Architecture**
    *   **Key Argument:** Negative Cash Conversion Cycle. We use pre-orders or short-term financing to fund the "Drop."
    *   **Data Injection:** Reference `project_data/research_data/yagpt/3_unit_economics_and_real_estate/1_location_dark_store_event_space.md` for "Dark Store" logic vs Showroom.
    *   **Tone Check:** CFO-level seriousness.

### [6. Operational Plan]
*   **6.1. Sourcing & Logistics Route**
    *   **Key Argument:** Direct Import from Europe/China. No intermediaries.
    *   **Data Injection:** Use `project_data/research_data/yagpt/2_supply_chain_and_logistics/1_routing_and_timing.md` to specify the route (e.g., Khorgos/Brest).
    *   **Visual Anchor:** `VIS-08 Customs Control.webp` (Caption: "Transparent Logistics Chain").
    *   **Tone Check:** Logistics precision.

*   **6.2. The "Kyrgyzstan Trap" (Risk Management)**
    *   **Key Argument:** We intentionally AVOID the "cheap" Kyrgyzstan route to protect the client from future fines (Resolution No. 152).
    *   **Data Injection:** **CRITICAL:** Insert math from `project_data/research_data/yagpt/1_legal_and_customs_framework/1_customs_payment_matrix_2025.md` showing the 2.5M RUB penalty risk.
    *   **Tone Check:** "Adult" responsibility. We value safety over cheapness.

*   **6.3. The Delivery Event**
    *   **Key Argument:** The handover is a show.
    *   **Data Injection:** Reference `project_data/research_data/yagpt/3_unit_economics_and_real_estate/2_cost_of_drop_event_cost.md` for the cost of the event ($2-3k).
    *   **Tone Check:** Theatrical logistics.

### [7. Financial Model]
*   **7.1. Unit Economics (The M5 Example)**
    *   **Key Argument:** Full transparency on the margin of a single car.
    *   **Data Injection:** **CRITICAL:** Use the exact calculation: Purchase Price + Customs + Logistics = Landed Cost (25,023,080 ₽) from `project_data/research_data/yagpt/1_legal_and_customs_framework/1_customs_payment_matrix_2025.md`.
    *   **Visual Anchor:** `VIS-07 Elite Logistics.webp` (Caption: "Value Chain Breakdown").
    *   **Tone Check:** Mathematical truth.

*   **7.2. OPEX & Break-Even**
    *   **Key Argument:** Low fixed costs (Dark Store rent) mean we break even at X cars/month.
    *   **Data Injection:** Use rent/staff costs from `project_data/research_data/yagpt/3_unit_economics_and_real_estate/3_financial_model_marginality.md`.
    *   **Tone Check:** Efficiency focus.

*   **7.3. ROI & Scalability**
    *   **Key Argument:** High ROI due to fast turnover.
    *   **Tone Check:** Investor appeal.

    *   **Key Argument:** We have the receipts.
    *   **Data Injection:** Detailed tables from all Research Files.
    *   **Visual Anchor:** `VIS-03 The Drop Event.webp` (Caption: "The Final Product").
