**Block 2.3: Spare Parts (ZIP) & After‑Sales Service – Comprehensive Analysis for “Social Status Drop”**
*Moscow, 2026*

## 1. Supply Chain & Logistics: Spare Parts (ZIP)

### Current Reality of Spare Parts Delivery to Russia (2025‑2026)
| **Channel**          | **Average Delivery Time (Body Parts & Tough Electronics)** | **Price Markup vs. EU Retail (Logistics Coefficient)** | **Key Risks** |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **European parts via UAE/Turkey** | 3–4 weeks (up from 10 days pre‑sanctions)[reference:0]; for some items (ECUs, specific sensors) 60–90 calendar days[reference:1]. | +40 % and more, depending on demand[reference:2]. | Customs delays, supplier audits, payment restrictions. |
| **Chinese‑origin parts**          | 45 days for container shipments[reference:3]; express options 9–13 days (air) but at a premium. | +30 %‑50 % due to logistics and currency fluctuations. | Quality variance, compatibility issues (different regional specifications). |
| **Local (Russian) warehouses**    | 1–3 days for available items.                              | +20 %‑30 % over EU prices due to limited supply.       | Limited assortment, often only consumables. |

**Recommendation:** Build a multi‑hub supply chain: urgent orders from local warehouses, routine orders via UAE/Turkey, and long‑lead items (ECUs, specific sensors) via China.

### Minimum Viable Stock (MVS) for 5‑10 Cars/Month
*Objective: Cover 80 % of routine maintenance and minor accident repairs without waiting for imports.*

| **Category**         | **Recommended Items (BMW M / Mercedes‑AMG)**                                                                 | **Estimated Stock Value (RUB)** |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Consumables**      | Oil filters, air filters, cabin filters, spark plugs, brake fluid, engine oil (5W‑30, 0W‑40), wiper blades, bulbs. | 300 000 – 400 000               |
| **Wear‑out Parts**   | Front & rear brake pads (2 sets each model), brake discs (1 set each), battery (1‑2 units).                 | 500 000 – 700 000               |
| **Crash Parts**      | Front bumper (1 per model), headlight (1 left/right per model), fender (1 left/right), hood (1).            | 1 200 000 – 1 500 000           |
| **Diagnostic/Soft**  | Common sensors (oxygen, wheel‑speed), fuses, relays, wiring harnesses.                                      | 200 000 – 300 000               |
| **Total MVS**        |                                                                                                             | **2.2 – 2.9 million RUB**       |

*Rationale:* This stock allows immediate response to most common service requests (oil changes, brake jobs, minor body damage) while limiting capital tied up in inventory.

## 2. Economic Model Comparison: In‑House vs. Outsource
*Assumptions: Boutique dealer selling 10‑15 cars/month; service volume ~30‑40 orders/month (including maintenance and repairs).*

### **Model A: In‑House Service (200 m² workshop in Moscow)**
| **CAPEX (one‑time)**               | **Estimated Cost (RUB)**                                                                                     |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rental deposit (3 months)          | 1 200 000 (assuming 400 000 RUB/month for 200 m²)                                                          |
| Two two‑post lifts                 | 300 000 (2 × ~150 000 RUB)[reference:4]                                                                     |
| Diagnostic equipment (licensed scanners for BMW/Mercedes) | 500 000 – 700 000 (professional tools, e.g., Autel MaxiSys, ThinkTool Expert)                              |
| Tooling, furniture, installation  | 400 000                                                                                                     |
| **Total CAPEX**                    | **2.4 – 2.6 million RUB**                                                                                   |

| **Monthly OPEX**                   | **Estimated Cost (RUB)**                                                                                     |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rent (200 m²)                      | 400 000                                                                                                     |
| Salaries (3 skilled mechanics)     | 540 000 (3 × 180 000 RUB, based on Moscow premium‑specialist rates[reference:5])                              |
| Utilities, consumables, insurance  | 100 000                                                                                                     |
| Marketing & administrative overhead | 150 000                                                                                                     |
| **Total Monthly OPEX**             | **~1.19 million RUB**                                                                                       |

*Break‑even point:* Requires ~25‑30 billable hours/month at an average rate of 4 000 RUB/hour (premium service) to cover OPEX.

### **Model B: Premium Outsourcing (Partnering with “Klubniy Servis” or similar)**
| **Cost Structure**                 | **Description**                                                                                              |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Commission to workshop             | Typically 25‑30 % of the total repair invoice (parts + labor).                                              |
| Our margin                         | 15‑20 % of the invoice (after commission).                                                                  |
| **Risks**                          | • **Reputation loss:** Quality control is in the hands of the partner; any service failure directly impacts our brand.<br>• **Limited priority:** Our clients may not receive preferential scheduling during peak periods.<br>• **Confidentiality risk:** Partner may directly poach clients. |

### **Verdict: Which Model is Financially Viable for the Startup Phase?**
| **Criterion**               | **In‑House**                                                                 | **Outsourcing**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Upfront investment**      | High (2.5 million RUB CAPEX)                                               | Negligible (only legal/partnering costs).                                       |
| **Monthly fixed costs**     | High (~1.2 million RUB OPEX)                                               | Low (only sales/coordination staff).                                            |
| **Control over quality**    | Full control; ability to guarantee turnaround times.                        | Limited; dependent on partner’s performance.                                    |
| **Scalability**             | Requires additional CAPEX/OPEX for growth.                                  | Easily scalable by adding more partner workshops.                               |
| **Risk exposure**           | High operational risk, but reputation risk is managed internally.           | Lower operational risk, but high reputation risk.                               |

**Recommendation for Startup Phase (first 12‑18 months):** **Outsourcing** is the more viable option. It avoids large upfront CAPEX and fixed OPEX, allowing the dealership to focus on sales and client acquisition. However, a **strict service‑level agreement (SLA)** with a selected premium workshop (e.g., “Klubniy Servis”) is essential, including:
*   Priority scheduling for our clients.
*   Transparent pricing with a fixed commission (25 %).
*   Regular quality audits and client‑feedback loops.

Once sales volume reaches 20+ cars/month and service demand is stable, transitioning to an in‑house facility becomes economically justified.

## 3. Legal & Warranty Framework (Risk Elimination)

### **Who Carries the Warranty Liability in Parallel Import?**
*   **Legal reality:** Under Russian consumer‑protection law (ZoZPP), the **seller who signed the contract with the client** is the responsible party for warranty obligations[reference:6]. In our model, that is **“Social Status Drop” (the Russian importer)**. The foreign manufacturer’s warranty does not apply in Russia[reference:7].
*   **Practical implication:** Any claim for defects, repairs, or even buy‑back must be handled by our company. This creates a significant contingent liability.

### **Proposed “Warranty Insurance” Mechanism**
To transfer this risk, we can integrate with insurance companies that offer **breakdown‑cover policies** specifically for parallel‑import vehicles.

| **Element**                | **Description**                                                                                              |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Product**                | “Extended warranty” insurance policy covering mechanical/electrical failures for 1‑3 years or up to 100 000 km. |
| **Coverage**               | Engine, transmission, drivetrain, ECU, major electronics (similar to manufacturer’s warranty).               |
| **Process**                | 1. Client purchases car from us.<br>2. We include the insurance policy in the sale (optional or bundled).<br>3. In case of failure, client contacts insurer; insurer authorizes repair at our partnered workshop (or any certified facility). |
| **Cost Estimate**          | *Per car per year:* **80 000 – 120 000 RUB** (depending on model, age, mileage). This cost can be either absorbed in the vehicle price or offered as an optional add‑on. |
| **Key Insurers**           | Companies like “VSK”, “Ingosstrakh”, “RESO” already offer similar products for parallel‑import vehicles[reference:8]. |

### **How This Eliminates Investor Fear**
1.  **Transfers liability:** The insurer becomes the financially responsible party for major repairs, limiting our exposure to unpredictable warranty costs.
2.  **Enhances client trust:** A formal insurance certificate is a tangible proof of warranty coverage, boosting consumer confidence.
3.  **Predictable costs:** The insurance premium is a known, fixed cost per car, simplifying financial planning.

**Implementation step:** Partner with one or two insurance providers to develop a tailored product for our BMW M/Mercedes‑AMG portfolio, with pre‑negotiated repair rates at our service partner.

## **Summary & Recommendations**

| **Aspect**                  | **Key Conclusion**                                                                                          | **Action Item**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Spare parts supply**      | Delivery times 3‑4 weeks via UAE/Turkey; cost +40 %. Minimum viable stock of 2.2‑2.9 million RUB required. | Establish contracts with logistics hubs in UAE/Turkey; procure MVS within 3 months. |
| **Service model**           | Outsourcing is financially prudent for the startup phase; in‑house becomes viable at 20+ cars/month.        | Negotiate SLA with “Klubniy Servis” or similar premium workshop within 1 month. |
| **Warranty risk**           | We are legally liable under ZoZPP. Warranty insurance transfers risk at a cost of ~100 000 RUB/car/year.    | Secure partnership with an insurance company for a tailored warranty‑insurance product. |

**Final verdict:** With a robust multi‑hub spare‑parts strategy, a carefully managed outsourcing model, and a warranty‑insurance backstop, “Social Status Drop” can reliably guarantee service quality and turnaround times to investors and clients alike. The proposed approach minimizes upfront capital while building a scalable, risk‑controlled after‑sales ecosystem.
